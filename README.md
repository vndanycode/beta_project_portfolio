# 🔮 Peculiarity

<h2>The main feature of this site, it seems to me, is sending a message by mail.  You can write something sms will come straight to my mail.</h2>

# ⁉ Why and what did I learn by programming this site?

<h2>I learned how to do animation correctly, how to leave comments in the project correctly, how to make slides, and how to properly adapt the site.  This is my second job after the project "Start UP".</h2>

# P.S.

<h3>The site is not about me, I made it up according to the layout.</h3>
